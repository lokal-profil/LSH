LSH
===
The redux branch is an attempt to cleanup the scripts and include the original steps needed to convert the original csv files to those required for the input

Assorted scripts used for [LSH batch upload](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/COM:LSH)

The SQL scripts were created by Fredrik Andersson at [LSH](http://lsh.se).

Included is PyCJWiki Version 1.31 (C) by [Smallman12q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Smallman12q) GPL, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

## TODO
Change over from PyCJWiki to WikiApi...

Requires [WikiApi](https://github.com/lokal-profil/ODOK/blob/master/tools/WikiApi.py)

WikiApi is based on PyCJWiki Version 1.31 (C) by [Smallman12q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Smallman12q) GPL, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

## Workflow

All of these should be run from the main code folder.

0. Copy config.py.sample to config.py and fill in your username and password
0. Run `python py_listscraper.py old_connections`  # To make a copy of the latest Commons mappings
1. Unpack the new csv files to the "original_csv" folder
3. Update CSV_FILES in "py_prepCSVData.py" to the new file names
4. Run `python py_prepCSVData.py`  # to populate a new "clean_csv" folder
5. Run `python py_analyseCSVData.py` and fix any errors, repeat until no actionable errors  # creates analysis-logg
6. Run `python py_crunchCSVData.py`  # to populate a new "data" folder
  * Note that this takes some time and that there are two prompts at the start
7. Run `python py_filenames.py`  # to generate the filenames
8. Run `python py_makeMappings.py`  # to create mappingtables for Commons
9. Upload the mapping tables to the right place
10. Do the actual mappings...

11. Run `python py_listscraper.py`  # to populate a new "connections" folder and update filenames
  * If filenames are updated then don't run again until Commons table has been updated.
12. Run `python py_prepUpload.py moveHits ../bilder` where ../bilder is the relative path to the main image folder  # moves the relevant files to base folders and adds extention to filenames
13. Run `python py_prepUpload.py makeAndRename ../bilder/m_a` etc. for each of the new image sub.folders  # creates info files and renames files
  * Check `造generator.log` for possible problems
14. Run `python py_prepUpload.py negatives ../bilder/m_a` etc. for each of the image sub.folders containing negatives  # creates a positive version and renames correctly
  * Check `造imageMagick-errors.log` for errorreports
15. Run `python py_prepUpload.py negativeCleanup ../bilder/m_a` etc. for each of the image sub.folders where 14. was run
  * Check `造conversion-errors.log` for problematic conversions (fix manually)
16. Run `python py_Uploader.py ../bilder/m_a` etc. to upload the files
  * Check `造uploader.log` for problematic uploads (fix manually, often by copying files back and trying again...)
